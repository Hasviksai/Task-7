create the table of sales in mysql in database.
opned jupiter notebook and installed the mysql connector 
tried to connect the database task_7 from my sql but the connection is not processing saying the errror in username and local host issue.
tried sqlalchemy by sorting the sollution in google but still the connection is not being made.
if the connection is done then calculating and plotting a graph can be done easily.
these are the findings i made in this task and understood the concept of connection python  and my sql theoritcally.
